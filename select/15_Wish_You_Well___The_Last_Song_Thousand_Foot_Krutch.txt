You can throw away your expectations now,
And all the things you wouldn't say out loud,
There's nothing left to pick apart now, the cards are all down
And now you know the sound of my heart, when it hits the paper,
There's no more mystery here... this is the last song

I remember when, we first became a band,
We'd drive all night and talk about the world,
I remember when, we used to, now and then,
Just sit and wonder where it all would go

This is the last song,...so everybody sing along,
This is the last song,... (X2)

You can throw away your expectations now,
And all the things you wouldn't say out loud,
There's nothing left to pick apart, now, the cards are all down
And now you know the sound of my heart, when it hits the paper,
There's no more mystery here... this is the last song

I remember when, we first became a band,
We'd set up in the bedroom, practice all night long,
I remember when, we used to, now and then,
Keep the neighbourhood up, from the sound of our guitars

I remember when, we'd all hop in the van,
Turn the radio on, we were off to see the world,
Wake up at ten, to do it all again,
Until the sun goes down, 'cause this is all we know

This is the last song,...so everybody sing along,
This is the last song,... (X2)

I remember when, we first became a band,
We'd drive all night and talk about the world,
I remember when, we used to, now and then,
...Just sit and wonder where it all would go

This is the last song,...so everybody sing along,
This is the last song,... (X2)
