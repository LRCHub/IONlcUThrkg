Wish I could call right now
Wish I could tell you everything
I need right now
If I could take away my faults
And never do you wrong again
If I could go back
I wouldn't hesitate
But I know by now
it's a little bit too late
I never thought
it was something I'd feel
It's hard to believe it's real
Where do we go now from here?
Would it be different
If you were more near?
I should have done
a little bit more
To stop you walking
out of that door
Oh but it's over now
All I could do is wish you well
Wish you could go right now
Wish you could get out of
My damn head right now
I'm trying to erase
all the thoughts
And never feel a loss again
Never again
So where do we go now from here?
Would it be different
If you were more near?
I should have done
a little bit more
To stop you walking
out of that door
Oh but it's over now
All I could do is wish you well
Where do we go now from here?
Would it be different
If you were more near?
I should have done
a little bit more
To stop you walking
out of that door
Oh but it's over now
All I could do is wish you well
