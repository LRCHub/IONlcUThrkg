Sometimes love feels like pain,
And sometimes I wonder if it's all the same,
Sometimes life, feels just like rain,
'cause you never know when it's gonna fall down on you
[Chorus]
I wish you well, I wish you well,
On this trip to find yourself,
I wish you well, wish I could help,
But I can't help you find yourself
Sometimes faith, feels like doubt
And sometimes I wonder if we'll even get out
Sometimes life hurts just like now,
But ya gotta know, it's all gonna come back around
[Chorus]
Find yourself,
I can't help you find yourself,
Find yourself..
And we were sixteen at the time,
Nothing could ever change our minds,
We were one step below invincible,
And we always fought it, you've never been the same,
You were so scared to make a name,
Then you threw it all away,
And I wish you'd come back now.
[Chorus: x 2]
[Chorus]
Find yourself,
I can't help you find yourself,
Find yourself,
I can't help you find yourself...
